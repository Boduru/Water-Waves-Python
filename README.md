# Water Waves Python
Python program that shows how to make 2D waves with Pygame.
    
I created this program using a tutorial that can be found on this page:
[2D Dynamic Splash Water Effect](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/make-a-splash-with-dynamic-2d-water-effects--gamedev-236)

This program uses the Thread Python module, with this module you can change the FPS constant used by Pygame and change the speed of the simulation.
